            <h1>Learn About the Historical Context of Hate Crimes in Canada</h1>
            <p>Historically, the recognition and prosecution of hate crimes in Canada have evolved over the past few decades, shaped by legislative changes, societal shifts, and key judicial decisions. Read more below.</p>

            <div class="application">
                <p>In the late 20th century, Canada began to formally recognize and address hate crimes through a series of legislative amendments. Concern emerged after the 1965 Cohen Report which highlighted hate propaganda's potential to erode societal values. This led to amendments to the Criminal Code in 1970, criminalizing hate propaganda (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, 2019). This laid the groundwork for stronger legal responses to hate crimes. It resulted in the 1996 amendment (Bill C-41) to the Criminal Code, establishing hate crime legislation and police units (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, 2019). This included provisions for hate propaganda (sections 318 and 319) and introduced sentencing enhancements for crimes motivated by bias, prejudice, or hate. These changes allowed for harsher penalties for perpetrators of hate crimes and established clear legal definitions and criteria for prosecuting such offences (Revised Statutes of Canada, (1985, c. C-46)). <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-45.html#h-121176">Click here to view the specific amendments to Criminal Code.</a></p>

            <div class="application">
                <p>The Cohen Report, officially known as the "Report to the Minister of Justice on Hate Propaganda", was published in 1965 by the Special Committee on Hate Propaganda in Canada, chaired by Dean Maxwell Cohen. This committee was established in response to increasing concerns about the spread of hate propaganda, particularly following the distribution of racist and anti-Semitic materials in the 1960s. The Cohen Committee's mandate was to examine the extent of hate propaganda in Canada and recommend appropriate legal measures to address it. The committee's investigation revealed several critical insights (Anand, 1998). <b>Their investigation revealed:</b></p>
                <li>Hate crimes were not widespread in Canada yet, but the concerning instances were targeted against Jewish and Black communities at the time.</li>
                <li>Highlighted negative impacts of hate crimes on the values of Canadian society.</li>
                <li>Highlighted the ethical obligation of the government to protect vulnerable communities from hate speech and propaganda.</li>
                <p><b>Key recommendations that they made:</b> Criminalizing hate propaganda, Harsher penalties for those found guilty of spreading hate propaganda, and Increased education and awareness campaigns.</p>
